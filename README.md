- 👋 Hi, I’m @MagnusdeAart
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a digital nomad for some time, making the network state a reality, geopolitcs, neuroscience (how does the brain work), starship, starlink and the boring company, learning languages (actual and programming).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things blockchain, because i want to become a blockchain developer. I swallowed the Balaji pill. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing so far, because i don't think i have enough knowledge yet to contribute something meaningful. Hopefully soon!
- 📫 How to reach me ...Soon probably on twitter :) Thanks for reading my profile!
